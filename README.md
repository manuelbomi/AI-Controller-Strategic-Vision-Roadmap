# AI Controller Strategic Vision & Roadmap
### Driving Intelligent Transformation for Teradyne's Compute Test Division (CTD)

---

## Executive Overview: Transforming Semiconductor Test Through AI Intelligence

#### Billions of test data points are generated every day across the semiconductor manufacturing lifecycle—from Wafer Sort to Final Test (FT) and System-Level Test (SLT)—creating petabyte-scale datasets that remain largely underutilized. Teradyne’s AI Controller Platform is designed to transform this untapped data into actionable intelligence that fundamentally redefines semiconductor test efficiency, adaptability, and precision.

#### The goal is to transition Teradyne’s industry-leading test equipment—such as UltraFLEX, J750, and other CTD systems—from being passive test executors to becoming AI-enabled, self-optimizing smart agents capable of learning from historical and real-time data to make intelligent test decisions.

#### By doing so, the AI Controller will:

- Reduce Defective Parts Per Million (DPPM) through predictive analytics and prescriptive control,

- Minimize redundant testing by identifying which parts of a device truly need to be tested,

- Accelerate product time-to-market,

- Boost CDT engineer productivity, and

- Scale Teradyne’s equipment versatility and global leadership in semiconductor test innovation.

## Purpose and Scope of the Current Repository (Repository 1)

#### This repository forms the strategic and conceptual foundation of the Teradyne AI Controller Program. It defines the overarching vision, roadmap, architecture, and strategic pillars that position the AI Controller as a transformative force in semiconductor test.

#### Specifically, Repository 1:

- Outlines the vision and benefits of the AI Controller platform and how it transforms the test lifecycle.

- Defines the AI Controller architecture, covering its Edge, Cloud, and Ecosystem integration layers.

- Establishes the strategic pillars for AI-driven adaptive testing, cross-lifecycle data intelligence, and collaborative innovation.
