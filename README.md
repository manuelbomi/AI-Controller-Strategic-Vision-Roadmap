# AI Controller Strategic Vision & Roadmap
### Driving Intelligent Transformation for Teradyne's Compute Test Division (CTD)

---

## Executive Overview: Transforming Semiconductor Test Through AI Intelligence

#### Billions of test data points are generated every day across the semiconductor manufacturing lifecycle—from Wafer Sort to Final Test (FT) and System-Level Test (SLT)—creating petabyte-scale datasets that remain largely underutilized. Teradyne’s AI Controller Platform is designed to transform this untapped data into actionable intelligence that fundamentally redefines semiconductor test efficiency, adaptability, and precision.

#### The goal is to transition Teradyne’s industry-leading test equipment—such as UltraFLEX, J750, and other CTD systems—from being passive test executors to becoming AI-enabled, self-optimizing smart agents capable of learning from historical and real-time data to make intelligent test decisions.

#### By doing so, the AI Controller will:

- Reduce Defective Parts Per Million (DPPM) through predictive analytics and prescriptive control,

- Minimize redundant testing by identifying which parts of a device truly need to be tested,

- Accelerate product time-to-market,

- Boost CDT engineer productivity, and

- Scale Teradyne’s equipment versatility and global leadership in semiconductor test innovation.
